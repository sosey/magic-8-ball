Got git or general software workflow and environment questions? Magic 8 Ball attemps to have the answers.

Would you like to just practice working with a github repository? Follow these steps:

* Make sure you have created a Github account
* Come back to this page and Fork this repository to your account, look in the upper right corner of your browser screen for the fork button, it's the last one in the "Unwatch" "Start" "Fork" chain
* Clone your copy (the fork) of this repository to your local disk:
    * go to the disk area you'd like the repository to be located
    * issue the command: `git clone https://github.com/your_user_name/magic-8-ball.git`
* You now have a copy of the repository to work with as you please! 

For further practice with GIT and GITHUB, checkout the Github Guide(https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) which details exercises that will lead you through some basic workflows, including branching, merging code, and making a pull request.
